=== 4. Final Documentation Structure

```
InvestiGator/
├── README.adoc                    # Main user documentation (enhanced)
└── docs/
    ├── DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.adoc     # Developer reference (new)
    └── CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.adoc # This summary (new)
```

== Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All user-facing documentation now in README.adoc
2. **Consistent Format**: Everything in AsciiDoc format
3. **No Duplication**: Removed redundant information across multiple files
4. **Developer Reference**: Critical technical notes preserved in DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.adoc
5. **Cleaner Structure**: From 14 markdown files to 2 organized AsciiDoc references

== Notes

* Table name verification issues were preserved in DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.adoc for future fixes
* All cache documentation was successfully consolidated into the main README.adoc
* Test results and achievements were integrated into the Testing section
