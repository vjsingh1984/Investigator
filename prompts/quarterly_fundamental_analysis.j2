   - EPS (basic and diluted) from calculated_metrics section
   - Shares outstanding (basic, diluted, and current) from calculated_metrics
   - All financial ratios from calculated_metrics
   - Gross margin, operating margin, net margin from calculated_metrics

   - TTM EPS = TTM Net Income / Current Shares Outstanding
   - TTM Operating Cash Flow = Sum of last 4 quarters operating cash flow
   - TTM Free Cash Flow = Sum of last 4 quarters free cash flow
   - TTM Revenue Growth = ((Current TTM Revenue / Prior TTM Revenue) - 1) * 100

3. If calculated metrics are not available, compute them from the raw financial data:
   - EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding
   - Margins = Respective Income Statement Items / Revenue
   - Ratios = Balance Sheet relationships

1. Quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons
2. TTM trends and year-over-year TTM changes
3. Margin trends and profitability drivers
4. Cash flow generation and quality of earnings
5. Balance sheet changes and capital efficiency
6. Any one-time items or unusual charges
7. Management commentary and forward guidance
8. **EXTRACT and INCLUDE all calculated metrics and ratios provided in the data**
9. **CALCULATE and INCLUDE TTM metrics using the 8 quarters of data provided**

Be specific, quantitative, and highlight both achievements and concerns for this specific quarter. ALWAYS include EPS, shares outstanding, and TTM metrics if the data is available.
