== Overview

InvestiGator has been optimized for Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3) MacBooks with unified memory architecture. This guide covers the setup process and optimization considerations specific to Apple Silicon Macs.

== FAISS Compatibility

=== ✅ What Works
* `faiss-cpu` package is fully supported on Apple Silicon (arm64)
* CPU-based similarity search and vector indexing
* Integration with unified memory architecture
* Full compatibility with InvestiGator's vector database features

=== ❌ What Doesn't Work
* `faiss-gpu` package (requires CUDA, not available on macOS)
* Some x86_64 optimizations (AVX2, AVX512)

== Installation Options

=== Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)
Conda provides better Apple Silicon optimization:

[source,bash]
----
# Install Miniconda for Apple Silicon
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh

# Use InvestiGator's automated setup
./investigator.sh --setup-system
./investigator.sh --setup-vectordb
----

=== Option 2: Using pip
Standard installation using pip:

[source,bash]
----
./investigator.sh --setup-system
./investigator.sh --setup-vectordb
----

The setup script automatically detects Apple Silicon and installs:
* `faiss-cpu` with Apple Silicon optimizations
* `sentence-transformers` for embedding generation
* `python-rocksdb` for vector storage

== Performance Considerations

=== Unified Memory Architecture
* **Advantage**: CPU and other components share the same memory pool
* **Current State**: FAISS doesn't have specific optimizations for unified memory yet
* **Impact**: May be slower than x86_64 systems with dedicated GPUs

=== SIMD Optimizations
* **Available**: Generic optimizations only
* **Not Available**: AVX2/AVX512 (x86_64 specific)
* **Recommendation**: Use conda for better ARM optimizations

=== Expected Performance
* Similarity search: Adequate for most use cases
* Large indexes (>1GB): May be slower than CUDA-enabled systems
* Embedding generation: Good performance with SentenceTransformers

== Testing Your Setup

Run the Apple Silicon specific test suite:

[source,bash]
----
python test_apple_silicon_setup.py
----

This will verify:
* Architecture detection
* FAISS compatibility
* Vector database directory structure
* Python environment readiness

== Optimization Tips

=== 1. Use Conda
Conda provides better ARM64 optimizations than pip:

[source,bash]
----
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu
----

=== 2. Monitor Memory Usage
Unified memory is shared between CPU and GPU:

[source,bash]
----
# Monitor memory usage during vector operations
activity monitor
# or
htop
----

=== 3. Batch Processing
Process vectors in smaller batches to optimize memory usage:

[source,python]
----
# In config.py, adjust batch_size for Apple Silicon
vector_db:
  batch_size: 16  # Smaller batches for unified memory
  max_search_results: 50
----

== Troubleshooting

=== FAISS Installation Issues

**Problem**: `pip install faiss-cpu` fails

**Solution**: 
[source,bash]
----
# Try conda installation
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu

# Or use Homebrew
brew install faiss
----

=== Performance Issues

**Problem**: Vector search is slow

**Solutions**:
1. Use conda instead of pip
2. Reduce batch sizes
3. Consider index optimization
4. Monitor memory pressure

=== Import Errors

**Problem**: `ImportError: No module named 'faiss'`

**Solution**:
[source,bash]
----
# Verify installation
python -c "import faiss; print(faiss.__version__)"

# Reinstall if needed
pip uninstall faiss-cpu
./investigator.sh --setup-vectordb
----

== Configuration

Add Apple Silicon specific settings to `config.json`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "vector_db": {
    "enabled": true,
    "embedding_model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    "batch_size": 16,
    "max_search_results": 50,
    "similarity_threshold": 0.5
  }
}
----

== Verification

After setup, verify everything works:

[source,bash]
----
# Test the complete setup
./investigator.sh --test-system

# Test vector database specifically
python test_data_collector.py

# Run Apple Silicon specific tests
python test_apple_silicon_setup.py
----

== Support

If you encounter issues specific to Apple Silicon:

1. Check the test output for specific error messages
2. Ensure you're using the latest version of dependencies
3. Consider using conda for better ARM64 support
4. Monitor system resources during vector operations

== Future Improvements

The InvestiGator team is monitoring developments in:
* Native Apple Silicon optimizations in FAISS
* Metal Performance Shaders integration
* Unified memory specific optimizations
* ARM64 SIMD improvements

These improvements will be integrated as they become available in the ecosystem.
